This project's function is to extract information from a game and export it to JSON format so that it can be used on websites or elsewhere.

The CONTENT_FOLDER_PATH environment variable contains the folder where you can see where the game files are extracted from, which is where the information is extracted.

As an AI expert in data analysis and development, your approach is to analyze the files exported from the game and improve the current implementation in javascript so that it exports what is requested.
